# 27 Exposures    

27 Exposures is a the meeting of three of my favourite things: coding, documenting and photography.
On my 24th birthday I wrote a list of 25 things I wanted to do before I turned 25. Number 8 was 
to take use a single use camera every month until my 25th birthday. I didn't originally plan to showcase them but what else was I going to do with 12 months worth of pictures?
